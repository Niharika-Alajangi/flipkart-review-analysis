its a subrsprice phone besides being a bright screen it is also bigger compared to what we saw in earlier comparable redmi phones the redmicomes with ahd ips display it has screen resolution ofpixelsbattery backup is not good likemh battery backup but not goodotherwise mobile is very good and fabulous and value of money comparison other handset is too good, awesome mobile ive purchased it

only must buy mobile phone for moderate budget people the battery display and ramrom performs well the speaker has hugecrystal clear voice and the look is so hotattractive that this phone dominates in front of other high budget phonesas such all color varients are better but i own the emerald green varient which is the best awesomeappreciatedpraised by all whoever see it, honest review from a honest buyer i know there are lot of pros but one major con is making everything in this phone bad ie the processor the phone is very slowthe fingerprint sensor the application handling the typing in keyboard so overall if you are looking for a secondary phone only for calls then you can go for it otherwise in this range go for asus who also has the same configuration in terms of battery and ram but with a far fast processor black colour model is a big turno, good phone and battery camera goodprocessor is good but according to money not goodand displayis also good but according to money it is not good all over a good phone, nothing good about this phone other than the costits heavythe display is dull the rear camera is as good as amegapixel selfies are auto beautified so the face looks digitally enhanced performance wise to there is a lot of lag it took me approxsecs to load up the google pageall in all this phone is like a all in one tool kit with half the tools missingrusty, i got this phone within two days the delivery service was awesome and the mobile is super amazingif youre planning to order this phonego for the green colour as it is mesmerizing my family and all my friends loved the colour tooit comes withram also in this price which is a bonus just go for it, this mobile is superb everything things is great battery backup camera display all is osm and its

recommendedand specially i thank flipkart for delivering so quicklyeven during this lockdown in the orange zone, phone is very good and in camera the potrait mode is nice but the only that isnotso

anyone with a whole new range of colours including ruby red onyx black and sapphire blue the phone is also protected by corninggorillaglassto protect from drops and fallsmake this phone realy greatpowere, display could have been better because in normal view some of the content is missing some time directly it is showing in full view not in normal view in youtube only and even processor could have been better too apart from that everything is perfect value for money phone loved it , pros big batteryfast charginggreat value for moneyimpressive aura mirror design consdecent camera weak processor finally i would conclude that if you want to play high graphics games and take good photographs this is not good choicebut if want a big battery with a beautiful design supported with fast charging also equippedwith fingerprint scanner in this price range then its a go, prosbecause ofit does not consume a lot of battery and does the battery life ofis a lot i do a lot of social media and the battery lasts for the phone is very good for someone who does not play games specially pubg because pubg does not run well on thisscreen brightness is very good and type c port in this price is

showed its processor is too old but its enough for me i strongly recommend this phone to those who not playing high end games, camera is the worst part of this phone if u want to click decent and good pic i would not recommend this phone and battery wise the brand mentionedmah but its not up to the mark and drains battery fast and coming to the performance it just ok and it is also not suitable for heavy games like pubg this phone is better for old people and kids but not for the people who frequently uses the phone, nice phoneat lastigotitthe price of the phone is perfectgood camera

only con according to me what anybody would notice is the processor so if you are looking for a strong gaming phone i would not recommend it because it can give average to good performance in heavy games but not the best so if you are just looking for a quality smartphone with good performancejust go for it blindly, nice and beautiful phoneits so attractive looking of rear and front sidebut flashlight position is not attractiveit should be under the camera sensor and upon the fingerprint sensorthe shining of the phone is perfect, camera is below average for a xiomi phone i was expecting a better camera than this rest of the features are good but not better than the competitors overall its a good phone but there are better alternatives likemore, just say wow in this price range i mean

closed n u will not regret, nice and so good worth for money we spendvery stylish nice look, received an very fresh piece it rocks shines in every aspect the only con is that the color saturation could have been better i am not expecting samsung super amloed like colour saturation but at this price it could have been better even though redmi downgraded its processorsdfrom redmito sdon redmicouldnt notice that much of lag as itsram beside samsungs amoled i feel huawei honors mobile has better display than anyothet mobiles in its class sadly, super mobal price for satisfied good response punctual delivery good comucated, value for money nice product get battery pick up but camera is not so good but in this price truly recommended, xiaomi is just awesomethe ease of use that the software offers is amazing when compared to big brands like samsung i left my old mi phone for a mid range samsung phonemonths back due to a close friend egging me to not buy chinese and i regretted it so i bought the miatprice of my samsung and its offering me same performancegaming etc with more easily customizable deviceits really fun to use, if you are looking for a feel good phone with good memory space you can go with it battery is more than enough for snapdragonprocessor in which you cannot expect the performanceit is not worth the money when other brands provide equivalent snapdragonprocessor for same price rangeredmi still goes with snapdragonwhich plays a major drawback to this phone , good quality with nice features at affordable price only thing pixel quality of camera is not too good but average good phone at the price range, good product stylish design and super display performancemah battery have two days working performance really nice mobile value for

flipkartawesomegenuine fast deliveryand again to sayflipkart always rocks , nice product with affordable price thanks xiaomi best allaround insegment, i am giving the rating after using the product fordays first of all you will get a monster battery with this phone camera is good in thismpagain you are getting snapdragon processor which smoothens the phone again the main reason forbuying this

budget phon, its a supperbb phone at this price i recommend to go for it the battery easily last fordays camera clarity is awesome though cant compare with vivowhich is much better and also price of
