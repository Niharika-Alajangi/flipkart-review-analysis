only must buy mobile phone for moderate budget people the battery display and ramrom performs well the speaker has hugecrystal clear voice and the look is so hotattractive that this phone dominates in front of other high budget phonesas such all color varients are better but i own the emerald green varient which is the best awesomeappreciatedpraised by all whoever see it, honest review from a honest buyer i know there are lot of pros but one major con is making everything in this phone bad ie the processor the phone is very slowthe fingerprint sensor the application handling the typing in keyboard so overall if you are looking for a secondary phone only for calls then you can go for it otherwise in this range go for asus who also has the same configuration in terms of battery and ram but with a far fast processor black colour model is a big turno, good phone and battery camera goodprocessor is good but according to money not goodand displayis also good but according to money it is not good all over a good phone, nothing good about this phone other than the costits heavythe display is dull the rear camera is as good as amegapixel selfies are auto beautified so the face looks

friendly mobile phone underim totally impressed with this mobile, since i am not a gaming freak this phone is perfect for me all my purposes from a smartphone is completely satisfied by redmireviews showed its processor is too old but its enough for me i strongly recommend this phone to those who not playing high end games, camera is the worst part of this phone if u want to click decent and good pic i would not recommend this phone and battery wise the brand mentionedmah but its not up to the mark and drains battery fast and coming to the performance it just ok and it is also not suitable for heavy games like pubg this phone is better for old people and kids but not for the people who frequently uses the phone, nice phoneat lastigotitthe price of the phone is perfectgood camera

only con according to me what anybody would notice is the processor so if you are looking for a strong gaming phone i would not recommend it because it can give average to good performance in heavy games but not the best so if you are just looking for a quality smartphone with good performancejust go for it blindly, nice and beautiful phoneits so attractive looking of rear and front sidebut flashlight position is not attractiveit should be under the camera sensor and upon the fingerprint sensorthe shining of the phone is perfect, camera is below average for a xiomi phone i was expecting a better camera than this rest of the features are good but not better than the competitors overall its a good phone but there are better alternatives likemore, just say wow in this price range i mean

good processor in this rangedisplay is ok camera performanceok cant expect much more in case of camera and display in this price range great display and camera setup design to show off quite

response punctual delivery good comucated, value for money nice product get battery pick up but camera is not so good but in this price truly recommended, xiaomi is just awesomethe ease of use that the software offers is amazing when compared to big brands like samsung i left my old mi phone for a mid range samsung phonemonths back due to a close friend egging me to not buy chinese and i regretted it so i bought the miatprice of my samsung and its offering me same performancegaming etc with more easily customizable deviceits really fun to use, if you are looking for a feel good phone with good memory space you can go with it battery is more than enough for snapdragonprocessor in which you cannot expect the performanceit is not worth the money when other brands provide equivalent snapdragonprocessor for same price rangeredmi still goes with snapdragonwhich plays a major drawback to this phone , good quality with nice features at affordable price only thing pixel quality of
