1,Vignesh Jayabal,Highly recommended,5,"I have bought the 128GB Product RED version. Being an Android user, it was a different hands-on experience of the XR and Iam really liking it.Display looks great, sound quality is great, camera quality is good and mainly the gaming performance is so smooth and fast and never felt a single frame drop ever.Even though its costly for an ""Budget"" apple iphone, it's worth the money I have spent on this mobile.READ MORE"

3,Akash Singh,Fabulous Product. Love It.!,5,"The phone has a supreme build and a sturdy feel in hands. Coming from a 6S, I felt it was a bit too wide, but It‚Äôll grow on you. The RED is by far the best color among available. And this one is an absolute battery champ and won‚Äôt let you down. Charging is also pretty fast if you use a fast charger. I use an iPad 12W charger to top it up and it goes from 10% to 90% within 90 mins. If we take in the factor of longevity of the iPhones (iOS support and updates for atleast next 5 years), this is ...READ MORE"

6,Flipkart Customer,Wonderful,5,"Awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è. Just go for it. I am very happy with my decision for buying XR instead of iPhone 8 Plus, X, XS and XS Max.

7,AAKASH  SIMSON,Great product,5,"I feel as if the people who gave the iPhone XR low ratings either didn't know what they were getting or didn't do research. I did a lot of research about the XR by watching a lot of Youtube videos of what the XR had to offer and the changes made from the previous iPhone models. The first thing is that the XR doesn't have a Finger Print Home Button, instead it uses Face Recognition to unlock it or a Pin Code. Second thing is that the Control Center has moved from swiping up from the bottom to ...READ MORE"

There is no phone in market above 30000 which provide chip level security. ios is more secured than android no doubt.

92,Flipkart Customer,Wonderful,4,"The Iphone XR has a great camera, good processor and a very good body finish. But the battery backup isnt yet that great.

Rest all works awesome.READ MORE"
