1,1,Sachin Pashte ,Awesome,5,"Overall, the screen of the Redmi 8 is pretty good considering its a sub-Rs 10,000 price phone. Besides being a bright screen it is also bigger compared to what we saw in earlier comparable Redmi phones. The Redmi 8 comes with a 6.22-inch HD+ IPS display. It has screen resolution of 1520x720 pixels.Battery backup is not good like 5000 mh battery backup but not good.Otherwise mobile is very good and fabulous and value of money comparison other handset is too good.READ MORE",1

10,10,Flipkart Customer,Simply awesome,5,"Awesom product. From my point of view, redmi 8 is the only must buy mobile phone for moderate budget people. The battery, display, and ram & rom performs well. The speaker has huge & crystal clear voice, and the look is so hot & attractive that this phone dominates in front of other high budget phones.As such all color varients are better, but I own the Emerald green varient which is the best, awesome & appreciated & praised by all, whoever see it.READ MORE",1
