# flipkart-review-analysis
With millions of reviews generated online every second it is impossible for a buyer to read all of them to decide if the product is worth their money. 
We have created this Machine learning model for an e-commerce company named GroDuo that helps the buyer form an opinion based on their preferences by 
classifying the reviews on the basis of its features of the particular product and then performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language processing(NLP) 
on these reviews to assign specific rating.

** Problem statement:
 Design a machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis of user reviews and classify it on the basis of product features.
 
** Relevance of the Project:
With millions of reviews generated online every second it is impossible for a buyer to read all of them to decide if the product is worth their money so our model will help the buyer to form an opinion based on their preferences.

** Objective:
To create a machine learning model to first classify the reviews on the basis of features and then perform sentimental on the features and predict the likeability of that specific feature in that product.

For the implementation of the model we have used jupyter notebook as our IDE. We have used different libraries of python such as :

1. Beautiful soups: We have used this to scrape the reviews of a particular product from the flipkart website.
2. Pandas : Pandas is used to import the csv file thatâ€™s been imported and also pandas make it easier to handle the dataset and provide some functionalities for analysis of the dataset
3. NumPy: It is used to handle the arrays in python with ease.
4. Matplotlib : It is a library that is used to plot the graphs of the given dataset
and visualise the data for analytical purposes.
5. re,nltk: These two libraries have been used for cleaning the data that has
been scrapped
6. TextBlob: This is used for sentimental analysis of the reviews and define its
polarity and subjectivity
7. WordCloud: It has been used for exploratory data analysis and to find out
the most frequent words that are used in the reviews by the users.
8. sklearn : This library contains many machine learning algorithms that are
used to train our data set on the basis of requirement.
